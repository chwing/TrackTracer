# TrackTracer

## The Problem

Have you ever been watching a concert video, live performance, or music festival stream on YouTube and wondered: *"What song is playing right now?"* 

As a music lover, you've probably experienced this frustration:
- Watching a live concert or DJ set
- Hearing an amazing track but having no idea what it is
- The description might list songs, but with timestamps that are hard to follow
- No easy way to identify which track is playing at a specific moment in the video
- Scrolling through comments hoping someone mentioned the song

**TrackTracer was created to solve this exact problem.**

## The Solution

TrackTracer is a web application designed for music lovers, festival-goers, and concert enthusiasts. It helps you identify songs from YouTube videos by:

1. **Accepting a YouTube URL** - Simply paste any YouTube video link (concert, live set, festival stream, etc.)
2. **Processing the video** - The app analyzes the video's metadata, description, comments, and captions to find song information
3. **Using Smart Detection** - If the video doesn't have an explicit playlist:
   - The app uses music recognition (Shazaming) at regular intervals
   - It searches through the entire video using binary search techniques
   - It identifies each track, its artist, and exact timestamp
4. **Displaying Results** - Get a clean, organized list of all songs playing in the video
